# TicTacToe!

TicTacToe but as a desktop app! 

Made with C# and AvaloniaUI as a way to start getting my hands dirty with C# and making real-world applications.

### How to Play

Play like normal tic-tac-toe. X goes first.

To win, get three in a row, column, or diagonal line. The game is over when there is a win or all the boxes are filled.
